# Key Layout
Find the full key layout screenshot image. Some prominent usage notes:  
  • Greek letters are mapped to the closest Latin letter key when possible, and glyphs identical to the Latin are omitted and serve for other symbols. Some symbols that maybe ought to enter your instinctual use are:  
 … · ≤ ≥ ÷ • ° × ≅ ± ∓ ≈ ≠ – — ‘ ’ µ ¢ ™ ¹ ² ³ ¼ ⅓ ½ ⅔ ¾
  • En-dashes "–" (AltGr+ -) and not hyphens "-" are correctly used with ranges, e.g. 14–16 people.  
  • Em-dashes "—" (AltGr+Shift+ -) and space-flanked en-dashes " – " are used in cases to replace parentheses, commas, and colons.  
  • Ellipses "…" (AltGr+ .) are distinct from three successive periods "...".   
  • Smart single quotation marks  " ‘ ’ " (AltGr+ 9/0), which appear curly/sloped in many fonts, are used in good typography over dumb quotation marks, which are just vertical lines.   

## Diacritic Marks
Enter diacritic marks after the character they need to be applied to. Feel free to modify this keyboard for your diacritic mark needs.  
  • Acute accent (AltGr+ '): x́  
  • Grave accent (AltGr+ `): x̀  
  • Diaresis (AltGr+ "): ẍ  
  • Macron (AltGr+ ,): x̄  
  • Tilde (AltGr+ ~): x̃
