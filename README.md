# Key Layout
Find the full key layout screenshot image. Some prominent usage notes:  
  • Greek letters are mapped to the closest Latin letter key when possible (e.g. AltGr+p: π), and glyphs identical to the Latin are omitted and serve for other symbols. Some symbols that ought to enter your instinctual use are:  
 … · ≤ ≥ ÷ • ° × ≅ ± ∓ ≈ ≠ ¬ – — ‘ ’ µ ¢ ™ ® ∞ ¹ ² ³ ¼ ⅓ ½ ⅔ ¾
  • En-dashes "–" (AltGr+ -) and not hyphens "-" are correctly used with ranges, e.g. 14–16 people.  
  • Em-dashes "—" (AltGr+Shift+ -) and space-flanked en-dashes " – " are used in cases to replace parentheses, commas, and colons.  
  • Ellipses "…" (AltGr+ .) are distinct from three successive periods "...".   
  • Smart/curly single quotation marks  " ‘ ’ " (AltGr+ 9/0), which appear curly/sloped in many fonts, are used in good typography over dumb/vertical quotation marks¹.

## Diacritic Marks
Enter diacritic marks after the character they need to be applied to. Feel free to modify this keyboard for your diacritic mark needs.  
  • Acute accent (AltGr+ '): x́  
  • Grave accent (AltGr+ `): x̀  
  • Diaresis (AltGr+ "): ẍ  
  • Macron (AltGr+ \): x̄  
  • Tilde (AltGr+ ~): x̃  

¹ Smart/curly double quotes are not encoded. The layout can be modified to encode them at the shifted positions of the smart single quotes, which currently have ∝ and ≡.
